**This project is a quiz app that I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a fun and simple website where users can answer multiple-choice questions and instantly find out if they got the answer right or wrong. The goal of making this app was to create an easy way for people to test their knowledge and see their score right away.

The app is designed to look neat and work smoothly. It shows one question at a time in the center of the screen with four answer options. There’s also a small text that tells you which question number you’re on, like “Question 1 of 5.” When someone clicks on an answer, the app instantly shows if it was correct by turning the option green or red. This gives quick feedback and helps users learn while playing.

All the quiz questions are stored in a simple format inside the code, using JavaScript. I used a list of questions and answers that the app picks one by one. When you click the Next button, it loads the next question automatically. At the end, the app calculates how many correct answers you gave and shows your final score.

Behind the scenes, the app uses JavaScript to control how the questions appear, how the score is counted, and how the answers are checked. It’s like the brain of the app. I didn’t use any fancy tools or outside libraries—just plain JavaScript—so I could understand everything that’s going on.

To make the app look nice, I used CSS for the design. I added colors, spacing, buttons, and styles to make the quiz card look modern and clean. The app also works well on phones, tablets, and computers, so anyone can use it on any device.

While building this project, I learned a lot about how websites work. I understood how to show and hide questions, how to save the score, and how to change the screen when users click something. I also learned how to make sure the page doesn’t reload every time someone answers—everything happens smoothly on the same page.

In the future, I can make this quiz app even better by adding a timer for each question, a scoreboard, different categories of questions, or saving high scores in the browser. But for now, this project shows that I can build a working, good-looking, and interactive quiz app using basic web development skills.**
